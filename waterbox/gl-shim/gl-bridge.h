/* The seam between a sandboxed machine and a real GPU.
 *
 * A waterbox guest has no libraries and no syscalls: it cannot open a display,
 * load libGL, or call anything the host did not hand it. What it CAN do is
 * call one function pointer the host registers with the sandbox
 * (wbx_get_callback_addr), whose shape is fixed - six integers in, one out.
 *
 * So every GL call the renderer makes crosses as (opcode, pointer to an
 * argument block in GUEST memory). The host is inside the same address space,
 * so it reads those arguments - and the vertex data and textures they point at
 * - directly, with no copying. That is what makes this affordable.
 *
 * The traffic is one-way by construction. The guest may hand the host pointers
 * into its own memory; the host may never hand back a pointer into the host's,
 * because the sandbox stops the guest reading it (and rightly). Anything a GL
 * call returns by pointer - a version string, a shader log - is copied into a
 * buffer the guest supplied.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS. The GPU is outside the sandbox, which means it is outside
 * the savestate, outside the determinism the rest of this core is built on,
 * and different on every machine. This is an experiment, off by default, and a
 * core running this way must say so rather than pretend its movies replay.
